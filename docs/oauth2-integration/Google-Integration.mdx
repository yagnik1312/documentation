# Google Integration

Learn how to integrate **OAuth 2.0** into your application.

## Getting Started

To integrate OAuth 2.0, you'll need Google OAuth credentials, which include:

- `Client ID`
- `Client Secret`

You can obtain these from [Google Developer Credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/) after creating a project and setting up OAuth consent.

### What you'll need

- Node.js version 18.0 or above
- Google OAuth credentials

## Backend Integration

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Navigate to your backend directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install passport passport-google-oauth20
```

### Step 2: Add Google OAuth Credentials to .env File

Create a `.env` file and add your Google OAuth credentials:

```plaintext
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```

### Step 3: Create GoogleStrategy with Passport

Create a file named `google_oauth.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
import passport from "passport";
import { Strategy as GoogleStrategy } from "passport-google-oauth20";

passport.use(
  new GoogleStrategy(
    {
      clientID: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
      callbackURL: "http://backend/auth/google/callback",
      passReqToCallback: true,
    },
    function (request, accessToken, refreshToken, profile, cb) {
      return cb(null, profile);
    }
  )
);
```
 callbackURL will be called when user is authenticated.
 callbackURL should be matched with Authorised redirect URIs of [Google Developer Credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/)


### Step 4: Setup OAuth Routes

Create an `oauth.js` file and add the following:

```javascript
import { Router } from "express";
import passport from "passport";
import "./google_oauth.js";

const router = Router();

router.get(
  "/auth/google",
  passport.authenticate("google", { scope: ["email", "profile"] })
);

router.get(
  "/auth/google/callback",
  passport.authenticate("google", {
    session: false,
    failureRedirect: "your-frontend-login-url",
  }),
  function (req, res) {
    const user = req.user;
    // Authentication successful
    // Process user as per your requirement, e.g., create a JWT token and pass it to the frontend
    res.redirect("your-frontend-home-url");
  }
);

export default router;
```
- Over here the route `/auth/google` is called when the user clicks Log in with Google in the browser. 
Behind the scenes, passport communicates with Google and directs the user to their respective consent screen.

- The consent screen tells users who is requesting access to their data and what kind of data the
 app is asking to access. The latter part of the statement comes under scope. In our app, we need access to the user's Google profile and email address, thus added it to the scope object.

- When an end-user approves our app in the consent screen, the redirect api's `(/auth/google/callback)` are invoked , req.user object is already set to the appropriate redirection(callback) URL through passport and the user lands on a page basis that.

- Since we are not maintaining session through cookies thus an additional session: false key was passed.

## Frontend Integration

### Step 1: Create Login with Google Button

Create a simple login button component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
  const handleGoogleLogin = () => {
    window.location.href = 'http://backend/auth/google';
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Google OAuth Authentication</h1>
      <button onClick={handleGoogleLogin}>Login with Google</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Step 2: Store JWT Token After Authentication

Create an authentication success page to store the JWT token:

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { useSearchParams } from 'react-router-dom';

const AuthSuccess = () => {
  const [searchParams] = useSearchParams();
  const token = searchParams.get('token');

  useEffect(() => {
    if (token) {
      localStorage.setItem('token', token);
    }
  }, [token]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Authentication Successful</h1>
      {token && (
        <div>
          <p>Welcome</p>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default AuthSuccess;
```
